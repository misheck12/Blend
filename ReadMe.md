# Blend
This project is a web-based platform for lending and borrowing books between individuals. 
Overview
This project is a web-based platform for lending and borrowing books between individuals. The goal of this project is to build a platform that allows users to lend and borrow books from each other, creating a community of book lovers who can share their books and help reduce waste.

## Key Features
User authentication: Users must be able to sign up and log in to the platform to use it.

Book listing: Users must be able to list their books and make them available for lending. The books can be searched and filtered based on different criteria, such as title, author, and genre.

Lending requests: Users must be able to request to borrow a book from another user. The lender must be able to approve or reject the request.

Notifications: Users must be notified when a lending request is made, approved, or rejected. They must also be notified when a book is returned.

User profiles: Users must have a profile page that displays their information, such as their name, location, and a list of books they have available for lending.

## Technical Requirements
Next.js: The project will be built using Next.js, a popular framework for building server-rendered React applications.

React: The frontend of the project will be built using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

API: The project will require an API to handle the communication between the frontend and the backend. The API can be built using a server-side technology and framework, such as Node.js with Express, or a pre-built backend-as-a-service platform like Firebase.

Database: The project will require a database to store information about the users, books, and lending requests. A NoSQL database, such as MongoDB or Firebase Firestore, can be used for this project.

## Project Phases
Set up the Next.js project and create the basic structure of the application.

Implement user authentication, including sign up, log in, and log out.

Build the book listing page, allowing users to search and filter books, and to view details about each book.

Implement lending requests, including the ability to request to borrow a book and to approve or reject requests.

Add notifications, so users are informed when a lending request is made, approved, or rejected.

Create user profiles, including a page to view a user's information and a list of books they have available for lending.

Test and debug the application, fixing any bugs and improving the overall user experience.

## Conclusion
Building a peer-to-peer book lending website is a great project for improving your skills in Next.js, React, and API development. By building this platform, you will gain experience in creating a full-stack application, from the frontend to the backend, and learn how to manage data and handle user interactions. Good luck!
