- Set up the Next.js project and create the basic structure of the application
- Create a new Next.js project using the command line or a Next.js starter template.
- Set up the file and folder structure of the project, including a pages folder for the Next.js pages and a components folder for the React components.
- Add the required dependencies to the project, including Next.js, React, and any other libraries or tools that you need.
- ## Implement user authentication
- Create the sign up and log in pages, allowing users to create an account and log into the platform.
- Store the user data in the backend, such as the username, email address, and password.
- Implement password hashing and validation to ensure the security of the user data.
- Add the ability to log out of the platform.
- ## Build the book listing page
- Create the book listing page, displaying a list of books that are available for lending.
- Add the ability to search and filter the books based on different criteria, such as title, author, and genre.
- Display the details of each book, including its title, author, description, and image.
- Implement pagination to allow users to view multiple pages of books.
- ## Implement lending requests
- Allow users to request to borrow a book by clicking a button or a link on the book detail page.
- Store the lending request information in the backend, including the borrower's username, the book title, and the date of the request.
- Notify the lender when a lending request is made, allowing them to approve or reject the request.
- Update the backend to reflect the approved or rejected request, and notify the borrower.
- ## Add notifications
- Notify users when a lending request is made, approved, or rejected.
- Notify users when a book is returned.
- Display the notifications in a dedicated section of the user interface, allowing users to view and dismiss them.
- Create user profiles
- Create a user profile page, displaying the user's information, such as their name, location, and a list of books they have available for lending.
- Allow users to edit their profile information, such as their name, location, and profile picture.
- Display a user's information, including their name and location, on the book detail page, so users can see who they are borrowing the  book from.

- ## Test and debug the application
- Test the application thoroughly, using different browsers, devices, and user scenarios.
- Fix any bugs or issues that are found during testing.
- Improve the overall user experience, making changes to the design and functionality as needed.
- By following this phased approach, you can break down the project into manageable tasks, allowing you to focus on one aspect of the project at a time, and make steady progress towards completing the full application.
